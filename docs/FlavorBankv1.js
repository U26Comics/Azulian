    "🌱☠️ Crushed a clutch of blinking larvae just to hear the sound. The mother emerged, all mouth and grief and swallowed you whole—you lived just long enough to hear the crunch of your own bones.",
    "🌱☠️ Laughed at the warnings, bit into forbidden fruit, mouth full of sweet poison, you danced as your vision melted, the world finally as strange as you’d always wanted.",
    "🌱☠️ Flirted with a man of another hominid strain out of boredom, got thrown out the airlock with next afternoon's trash.",
    "🌱☠️ Slipped into the ship’s restricted pool for a secret swim and got sucked into the intake—ΔP tore you apart faster than you could shout for help, pulling you through a grate no wider than your wrist.",
    "🌱☠️ Thought the sponge-trees were safe until one uprooted itself and dragged you under, roots squeezing until you popped like overripe fruit.",
    "🌱☠️ Mocked the human researchers for fearing the ground was alive—seconds later, something with too many jaws made you part of the landscape.",
    "🌱☠️ Assumed the sulfur pool was empty; a blue-limbed grazer disagreed, swallowing you whole and venting your gear two miles downstream.",
    "🌱☠️ You were the first to disembark into the fresh alien biosphere, it's flora and fauna untouched, undiscovered and ripe for the taking. Then you heard something repeating 'help. help. help.' from the scrubline."],

  "🔥☠️ Lived for the hunt, hunted for the kill—bled out on black sand under an alien sky with no audience but the scavengers.",
  "🔥☠️ After decades of carnage, you thought yourself immortal. An unexpectedly clever alien's trap made a mockery of your delusion before they killed you, thinking it would change the fact that their civilization wouldn't exist by next sunrise.",

  "🔥☠️ You left a thousand dead worlds behind you—now you join them, just another stain in the dark.",
  "🔥☠️ You tore through the swarm in a haze of berserker chemicals, roaring with laughter until you collapsed atop a hill of alien corpses, shot full of holes you never felt.",
  "🔥☠️ You screamed defiance, hacking limbs and flesh until the world spun with crimson and teeth. You didn’t notice your own guts trailing behind you until your hands went slack and the ground rose up to meet you.",
  "🔥☠️ Didn’t hear your squad screaming for retreat, didn’t feel the acid burning your skin; you died with your fists locked in something’s throat, grinning blood.",
  "🔥☠️ Out of ammo, out of time, but high on slaughter, you ripped and bit until nothing moved but your own blood across the cold metal of a Xeno warship.",
  "🔥☠️ A miscalculation in the gellar field turned your bones to glass and your blood to dust, both equally hard to sweep up.",

  safariFlavor: ["🐀🥩 The Humvee never stopped for potholes, just for bodies. Your group debated which pose was more ‘avant-garde’ for the trophy photo.",
    "🐀🥩 A poor man begged to be spared; your host called it ‘interactive performance’ and poured him a drink before gutting him.",
    "🐀🥩 They said it was about population control, but really, it was just about having a good time. The tour guide offered napalm and a camcorder for an extra fee. You splurged. What good was money if you never used it to enjoy yourself?",
    "🐀🥩 Safari concluded. War crimes photographed for private albums.",
    "🐀🥩 Rat Hunters took a holiday safari through the floodplains. Came back wearing new skins.",
    "🐀🥩 Hunt complete. You spent the evening comparing screams like vintages.",
    "🐀🥩 A vet shot a beggar to test her new augment; crowd applauded accuracy."

  bloodFlavor: ["🩸🥩 You cheered as two Dependias fought to the death for rent money. The winner cried when he realized the prize was a one-way ticket to the next round.",
    "🩸🥩 The only thing cheaper than a life in the arena was the drink they served in the VIP lounge.",
    "🩸🥩 The arena stank of sweat, blood, and despair—nobody had bothered to clean up after last week’s massacre.",
    "🩸🥩 You attended blood sports. Hunters bragged of cleansing dirtbloods. Even Yebra disowned the footage.",
    "🩸🥩 They tied a starving poet to a pole and let the carca have him. Called it 'art therapy'",
    "🩸🥩 A Dependia escaped the pits and begged the Hunters for mercy. They filmed his laughter as proof of consent.",
    "🩸🥩 Returned from safari with a necklace of tongues. Claimed each one lied."
